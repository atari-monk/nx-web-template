## Technical notes

### nx cli

1. Generated game service and socket-events.service.ts (nest)

```bash
nx generate @nrwl/nest:service game --directory server/src/game
```

```bash
nx generate @nrwl/nest:service socket-events --directory server/src/game
```

### Problems

1. There was some errors with js modules as usual, adding "type": "commonjs", to root package and nx reset helped.

## Message on connection status.
